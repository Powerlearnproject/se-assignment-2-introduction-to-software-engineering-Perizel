        {
            "question": "Software Design Principles:",
            "answer": "Modularity is a design principle that divides a software system into separate, interchangeable modules, each of which contains everything necessary to execute only one aspect of the desired functionality. This improves maintainability as each module can be developed, tested, and debuged independently, and scalability as modules can be added, replaced, or updated without affecting the entire system."
